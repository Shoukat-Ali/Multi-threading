This is an attempt to show some examples of multi-threading C programs using pthread on Ubuntu. These examples are not meant to be exhaustive but hope that you'll find the range of programs useful/interesting. 

You'll find some instructions and explanations at the top of each program in the ***test*** directory where the ```main()``` function is defined.

# Examples

The examples include a basic demonstration of creating and managing multiple threads by passing arguments to threads and synchronizing their completion with the main/parent thread using using ```pthread_join()``` function.
